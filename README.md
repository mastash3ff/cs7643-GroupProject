# CS7643 - Group Project

## About

Dense pixel prediction tasks group project. Leverages Pytorch, MMDetection, and SwinTransformer models for producing results on a truncated COCO 17 dataset.

Contains experiments used for establishing baseline performance and fine-tuned model performance mostly in the ```SwinTransformer_MaskedRCNN.ipynb``` notebook.

## Configurations

Files used to produced trained and fine-tuned models can be found in the configs folder.
